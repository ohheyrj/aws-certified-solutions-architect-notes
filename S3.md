## Overview

S3 (or Simple Storage Services) was one of the first services offered by AWS, as a result it features heavily in the exam. It is a object store unlike EBS which is block storage. Object storage is where you store a file as apposed to block storage where you might install a OS for example. There is no limit to the amount of storage that you can use.

## Key Facts

### Storage Classes of S3

There are four storage classes in S3. They are:

- Standard
- IA or infrequent access
- One-Zone IA (Infrequent Access)
- Glacier

Each class has a different availability and durability rating.

### Availability

Each storage class has been designed for a different availability level. They are:

|Storage Class      | Availability      |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
|Standard           |99.99%             |
|IA                 |99.9%              |
|One-Zone IA        |99.5%              |
|Glacier            |N/A                |

### Durability

Each storage class has the same durability level:

|Storage Class      | Durability      |
|:-----------------:|:---------------:|
|Standard           |99.999999999%    |
|IA                 |99.999999999%    |
|One-Zone IA        |99.999999999%*   |
|Glacier            |99.999999999%    |

However, as noted in the AWS documentation, because S3 one zone-IA is only storage in one AWS availability zone, if that AZ is destroyed or if the region is off-line the data will be lost.

### Consistency Models

There are two consistency models used when uploading content to a S3 bucket. For new PUT requests the consistency model used is read after write consistency, meaning that once the file is uploaded you can read it immediately. For overwrite PUT and DELETE requests it is eventual consistency, meaning that if you upload the file and then try to access it you may not get the updated copy.

When uploading files to a S3 bucket you should get a 200 code to signal a successful upload.

### Bucket URLs

Bucket URLs have the same format across all regions, however there are two ways that they can be addressed. They can either be addressed virtual-hosted-style or path-style. This is a virtual-hosted-style address:

```text
http://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com
OR
http://bucketname.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
```

If you don't specify the region in a virtual-hosted-style link the DNS has enough information to pass it onto the correct region.

This is a path-type address:

```url
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bucketname (US East, N. Virginia)
http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname
```

As you can see, you must specify the region that your bucket is in if using the path-style address. The only exception to this is if your bucket is in US East North Virginia, where you do not specify the region.

## S3 Storage Classes

### Standard

- Standard storage has a availability of 99.99%.
- The data is resilient in the event of one AZ destruction.
- Has low latency and high throughput performance.

### Infrequent Access or IA

- IA has a availability of 99.9% and is resilient in the event of one AZ destruction.
- Has lower latency and high throughput performance.
- IA is set the object level and can exist in the same bucket as S3 standard.
- Has a lower storage and per GB retrieval fee

### One Zone-Infrequent Access

- One Zone-IA has a availability of 99.5%.
- Has a low latency and high throughput performance.
- Is stored in a single AZ, meaning it is not resilient if the AZ goes down.
- Set at the object level, meaning it can reside with standard and IA objects in the same bucket.
